# Yusuf Tarek - Data Analyst

Hello! I'm Yusuf Tarek, a dedicated computer science graduate with a passion for Business Intelligence (**BI**) and **data analysis**. I bring a diverse skill set, combining proficiency in **SQL**, **Power BI**, **Python**, and **Excel**. With a solid background in IT support, I've honed my technical skills and gained hands-on experience.

My academic journey was concluded with a graduation project focusing on image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Skills were further enhanced through a diverse array of **courses** and **certifications**, encompassing IELTS, **Database Fundamentals**, and participation in a **Data Analyst Bootcamp**.

In the domain of data analysis, diverse **projects** were undertaken, including those related to: 
  Bike sales
  Coffee orders
  Hotels revenue. 
These projects serve as a testament to the **ability** to translate **raw data** into **meaningful insights**. 
Proficiency in tools such as **Power BI**, **SQL**, and **Python** is complemented by soft skills, including effective communication, documentation practices, and a meticulous attention to detail.


As a junior **data analyst**, I'm eager to contribute my **analytical** and **problem-solving** skills to a dynamic team. Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories for a closer look at my projects and capabilities. Connect with me on LinkedIn or drop me an email at yusuftarek18turk@gmail.com to discuss potential collaborations or opportunities. I'm excited about the prospect of leveraging data to drive informed decisions and make a positive impact!
